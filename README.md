# `eslint-plugin-replyguy`

The ESLint plugin you definitely didn’t ask for.

This plugin was inspired by [@cassidoo’s Reply Guys video](https://twitter.com/cassidoo/status/1284201376516435968) and multiple daily reminders that no matter what you tweet, there’s a Reply Guy ready to tell you you’re wrong. [@tesseralis was tweeting about this long before I had this idea.](https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1260665841978204161)
